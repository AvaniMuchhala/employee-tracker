# Employee Tracker

## Description

Employee Tracker is a command-line application to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL. This was built for business owners to easily view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in their company. With this app, they can also add a new department, role, or employee, update an employee's role, and view the total utilized budget in a department. This project helped me understand how a MySQL database works as well as how to use the MySQL2 package to connect to the database and perform queries via JavaScript.
